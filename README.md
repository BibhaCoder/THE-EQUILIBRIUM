THE EQUILIBRIUM: a hidden wisdom and language of common sense
____________________________

The secret of a successful and fulfilling life is to achieve a healthy balance between various elements, thoughts and philosophies available in the universe. As the earth's balanced distance(not too far and not too close) from the sun ensures flourishing of diverse life and ecosystem on earth, similarly a healthy balance between dark matter and dark energy ensures survival of our very own universe. Similarly for a successful and fulfilling life we need to maintain a healthy balance in our life and avoid extremes of anything.

Every star in our universe shines because of the balance between its massive gravity crushing it down vs nuclear fusion in its centre trying to blow it away. Similary our lives needs balance and avoid extremes of any kind. Every human being is born with quality of altruism and selfishness but the best of human beings comes out from the balance between altruism and self preference. Every human being also has left and right political thoughts. Extreme left and extreme right wing politics both are wrong and destructive to society. A perfect political system is a healthy balance between left and right wing politics. Successful survival of human beings on this earth requires a healthy  balance between industrial development and protection of climate and natural ecosystems. 

THE EQUILIBRIUM can help us to find solution of so many of our everyday problems. Anyone who wants to live a long life filled with health, wealth, wisdom and vitality(**ALIVE**)requires THE BALANCE. Whenever there is a problem and our mind gets stretched between two thoughts most of the time the solution lies in the middle(THE BLANCE) of both the thoughts.

If we carefully observe around us we can see THE EQUILIBRIUM at work everywhere. In human life perfect health comes from balance between various elements. Natural ecosystem survives and thrives because of THE EQUILIBRIUM between various elements. In universe we see THE EQUILIBRIUM is at work everywhere.
